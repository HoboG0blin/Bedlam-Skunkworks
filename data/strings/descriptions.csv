bedlamskunkworks_chromedusa,SHIP,"A fearsome ship whose top tier engines provide great speed and maneuverability for a destroyer. Multiple energy weapon slots allow for a plethora of tactical possibilities. Its best-in-class performance is matched by a demanding logistical profile that has led some fleet commanders to eschew its use in favor of ships which can be deployed more frequently and cheaply.

The Medusa is one of the most respected destroyers in the Sector due to its association with black ops and elite pirates, and the few spacers who have crewed aboard a Medusa can attest to its technological sophistication.

Medusa-class blueprints are few in number and are closely guarded by their owners; pirates have acquired a Medusa-class hull only a handful of times and the results were inevitably drastic, though short-term, threat to local patrols and subsequent reduction in small to medium intrasystem shipping volume. Such events are considered a tremendous nuisance, particularly accounting for increased insurance premiums. Many trade combines will simply call for their fleets to wait for the pirates to run down their new toy's combat readiness so that local authorities can remove the problem once and for all.",,,,,

,,,,"It doesn't take a detailed survey to ascertain that this is a planet rich in transplutonic ore: the remains of a crude, automated mining-refining operation sprawl like an uncontrolled growth across the surface. It is withered now, the fusion reactors left cold, hundreds of autoforged kiloton teleminer units like dead beetles seemingly swept into drifts by a titanic wind.",,,
